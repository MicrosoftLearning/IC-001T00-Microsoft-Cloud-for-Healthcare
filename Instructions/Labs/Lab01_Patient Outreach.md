Module 4 Lesson 1- Lab 1: Patient Outreach
==========================================

## Overview

The **Patient Outreach** application in Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare allows
healthcare providers to communicate with their communities and patients in a
targeted, efficient way. Patient Outreach is a patient campaign management
application that helps you organize and automate marketing and outreach to
patients.

Key capabilities of **Patient Outreach** include:

-   Patient segmentation - Prebuilt patient segments are based on the industry
    standard Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) to
    provide baseline patient cohorts.

-   Patient engagement campaigns - Create healthcare-specific email campaigns
    that use patient segments based on the HEDIS industry standard.

-   Event management - Use provider and payer event management templates for
    event administration and registration.

Patient Outreach focuses on the **Enhance patient engagement** priority scenario
by creating personalized communication based on patient insights.

This lab focuses on the healthcare story of Elizabeth Moore.

![Timeline Description automatically generated](./IMAGES/L1P2.png)

At an annual checkup earlier this year, Elizabeth learned that she has
hypermetropia, a common eye condition in adults in which nearby objects are
blurry. Lamna Healthcare Company has seen a recent influx of patients who want
to be more educated on hypermetropia and has decided to increase their patient
outreach efforts by hosting a virtual marketing event.

In this lab, you will play the role of a Lamna Healthcare Company marketing
administrator and will use the Patient Outreach capabilities in Microsoft Cloud
for Healthcare to create a virtual marketing event.

## Learning objectives

In this lab, you will:

-   Create a patient segment.
-   Create a marketing email.
-   Create a patient journey.
-   Create a healthcare marketing event.

## Exercise 1: Create a Patient Segment

In this exercise, you will create a Patient Segment using the Patient Outreach
app in Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare. A **Patient Segment** is used to group
patients into cohorts based on similar characteristics so that they can be
better targeted with marketing communications. In this example, you will create
a Patient Segment for patients with hypermetropia (a vision condition in which
nearby objects are blurry).

1. [] Navigate to +++https://make.powerapps.com/+++ and log into your Microsoft 365 tenant, if needed.

1. [] If needed, change the environment from **Contoso** to **MC4H Labs** on the top bar. Go to **Apps** and open **Marketing**.

    ![Graphical user interface, text, application, email Description automatically generated](./IMAGES/L1P3.png)

1. [] Navigate to the bottom left drop-down and change the selection from **Real-time Marketing** to **Settings**.

    ![Graphical user interface, text, application Description automatically generated](./IMAGES/L1P4.png)

1. [] On the **Settings overview** screen, select **Dataset configuration** under **Data management**.

    ![Graphical user interface, application Description automatically generated](./IMAGES/L1P5.png)

1. [] Scroll down and select the **Condition (msemr_condition)** entity.

    ![Graphical user interface, text, application Description automatically generated](./IMAGES/L1P6.png)

1. [] Select **Publish Changes** on the top right and select **OK** twice.

    ![Publish Changes.](./IMAGES/L1P7.png)

    > [!NOTE] Note: While it may take up to 30 minutes for changes to take effect, they are generally ready in a few minutes.

1. [] Go back to **Apps** and open **Patient Outreach**.

    ![Graphical user interface, text, application, email Description automatically generated](./IMAGES/L1P8.png)

1. [] Select **Segments** on the left navigation bar to create a new specific group of patients.

    ![Click Segments to create a new specific group of patients.](./IMAGES/L1P9.png)

1. [] Select **New** to create a new Patient Segment. Select **+ New Dynamic Segment**.

    ![Select New to create a new Patient Segment. Select + Dynamic Segment. ](./IMAGES/L1P10.png)

    > [!KNOWLEDGE] Did you know? Static segments enable you to choose and add segment members manually based on existing lists or search results. Dynamic Segments, which you define by using a set of rules and conditions, are constantly and automatically changing based on information in your database. Since we want our group to change depending on database information, we are choosing the dynamic segment option.

1. [] When prompted to choose a **Segment Template** option, select **Skip** since we will create our own Segment.

    ![Graphical user interface, application Description automatically generated](./IMAGES/L1P11.png)

1. [] Name the new Segment +++**Patients with Hypermetropia**+++. Select **Add query block.**

    ![Name the new segment "Patients with Hypermetropia"](./IMAGES/L1P12.png)

    ![Graphical user interface, text, application, email, Teams Description automatically generated](./IMAGES/L1P13.png)

    We will now create a new Segment for Active Patients who have a Hypermetropia condition where the Contact has a Status of Active, and the related Condition Description contains “Hypermetropia”. Configure this new segment by doing the following:

1. [] Leave **Contact** as the main entity.

1. [] In the **Select attribute** drop-down, select **Status** from the list of fields.

1. [] When the additional fields appear, set condition to Status **Is Active**.

1. [] Select **Add > Add related entity**.

    ![Graphical user interface, text, application Description automatically generated](./IMAGES/L1P14.png)

    It should default to **AND** in the drop-down. Now let’s add the second part of the condition.

1. [] In **Select related entity** drop down, choose **Condition (Condition -> Contact (Patient))**.

1. [] Select the nested **Add > Add condition to Condition**.

    ![Graphical user interface, text, application, email Description automatically generated](./IMAGES/L1P15.png)

1. [] Select attribute **Condition (msemr_name)**.

1. [] Change the operator to **Contains** and type +++**Hypermetropia**+++.

    ![Graphical user interface, text, application Description automatically generated](./IMAGES/L1P16.png)

1. [] Select **Save** and then select **Go live** to publish the segment (you won't be able to use it in a customer journey until it goes live, even though you've saved it).

    ![Select Save and then select Go live to publish the segment (you won't be able to use it in a customer journey until it goes live, even though you've saved it).](./IMAGES/L1P17.png)

1. [] Select **Refresh** on the command bar to refresh the page. Select the **Members** tab to see which patients have been added to the Dynamic Segment. Notice Elizabeth Moore in the list who will eventually be a recipient of our marketing event outreach email.

    ![Graphical user interface, text, application, email Description automatically generated](./IMAGES/L1P18.png)

## Exercise 3: Create a Patient Journey

In this exercise, you will create a Patient Journey for the patient segment that you created in the first exercise. A **Patient Journey** can expand your
organization’s patient outreach marketing capabilities by helping healthcare organizations guide the members of a selected segment through the communication process. It does this by using automated messaging, activity generation, interactive decision points, and more.

Here is an example of a configured **Patient Journey**, which focuses on the Patient Activation Measure segment group and sends them a marketing email after a 3-month waiting period.

![Patient Journey selected on site map](./IMAGES/L1P34.png)

Now let’s make our own customer journey for patients with hypermetropia.

1. [] In the **Patient Outreach** app, select **Patient journeys** under **Marketing execution** on the Site map.

    ![Graphical user interface, text, application, chat or text message Description automatically generated](./IMAGES/L1P35.png)

1. [] Select **New** to create a new Patient Journey.

    ![Click New to create a new Patient Journey](./IMAGES/L1P36.png)

1. [] When prompted to choose a **Customer journey template** option, select **Skip** as we will create our own customer journey.

    ![Click Skip as we will create our own customer journey](./IMAGES/L1P37.png)

1. [] In the **Designer** view under **Who do you want to be on this journey?**, select the plus sign to **Set audience.**

    ![New customer journey screenshot](./IMAGES/L1P38.png)

1. [] In the **Audience** panel that shows on the right, search for the **Patients with Hypermetropia** segment that you created in the previous task.

    ![Find the “Patients with Hypermetropia” segment that you created in the previous task](./IMAGES/L1P39.png)

1. [] Select “**Patients with Hypermetropia**” for the source segment.

    ![select “Patients with Hypermetropia” ](./IMAGES/L1P40.png)

1. [] Select the **General** tab and rename the record to +++**Healthy Eye Seminar**+++. Select **Save**.

    ![Name the record Healthy Eye Seminar](./IMAGES/L1P41.png)

1. [] Go back to the **Designer** tab. On the canvas between the Start and End arrows after the starting box, select **Add tile** using the blue plus sign (**+**) that appears when you hover over the line. 

    ![Add button appears in designer tab](./IMAGES/L1P42.png)

1. [] Select **Send an email** from the contextual menu.

    ![select Send an email from the contextual menu](./IMAGES/L1P43.png)

1. [] In the panel on the right for the **Email** field, select the marketing email **Email Invitation – Healthy Eye Seminar Virtual Event** that you created in the previous exercise.

    ![Customer Journey Designer View to select an email](./IMAGES/L1P44.png)

    ![Select the “Email Invitation – Healthy Eye Seminar” email that you created in the previous task](./IMAGES/L1P45.png)

1. [] Select **Save.**

    ![click save for customer journey](./IMAGES/L1P46.png)

1. [] Switch to the **General** tab to configure the run schedule for your customer journey. Enter a **Start and End** date and time that makes sense for your event. If you want to see insights for the journey, choose an upcoming **Start time** on today’s date. Remember the dates you enter for the next exercise.

    ![Graphical user interface, application Description automatically generated](./IMAGES/L1P47.png)

1. [] Select **Save**.

1. [] Your journey is now ready to go. To start the journey, navigate back to the **Designer** tab and publish it by selecting **Go live** on the command bar.

    ![select go live on the command bar](./IMAGES/L1P48.png)

1. [] Dynamics 365 Marketing copies the journey to its email marketing service, which executes the journey by processing contacts, performing actions, and collecting results during the time it is set to run. Watch the journey's **Status Reason** as it sequences through **Going Live** to **Live**.

    ![Your journey is now ready to go. To start the journey, publish it by selecting Go live on the command bar](./IMAGES/L1P49.png)

1. [] Once your patient journey runs, you will be able to gather **key metrics and insights** from the record. When this information is available depends on the date and time you chose for the start of the customer journey. You may come back to see the results later if they aren’t yet available.

**Congratulations**! You have created a patient journey by utilizing the patient segment and marketing email you created in the previous exercise.
