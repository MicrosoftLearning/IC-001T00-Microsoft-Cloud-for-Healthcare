# Module 4 Lesson 1- Lab 3: Patient Access & Service Center

## Overview

Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare includes Patient Access and Patient Service Center.

You can provide patients with access to their health data, in-person and virtual appointment scheduling, and information through knowledge articles. Patient Access provides a portal that will help you give patients the ability to chat with a health bot, communicate with a caregiver, and view their clinical data.

Patient Access includes the following capabilities that you can provide to your patients:

-   **Access** - Patients have a user-friendly portal to access their health information.
-   **Direct engagement** - Patients can engage through automated chat conversations that will hand off to your patient service center.
-   **Scheduling and messaging** - Patients can schedule appointments and send messages to their providers.

In the Patient Service Center, you can engage with your patients in the way that they want while monitoring automatic conversations through the Microsoft Azure Health Bot service. Additionally, service agents can help your patients with information and setting up appointments.

The Patient Service Center includes the following capabilities:

-   **Monitor patient conversations** - An ongoing conversations dashboard provides information on the conversations that are handled by the agents and integrated bots.
-   **Agent scripts** - Use provider-specific agent scripts to address patient issues.
-   **Monitor effectiveness** - Conversation intelligence provides insights for service center managers on agent performance.
-   **Follow-up** - Send follow-up surveys on patient satisfaction, reminders on appointments, and more.
-   **Appointment scheduling** - Schedule or reschedule appointments during conversations with patients.

The Patient Access Portal and Patient Service Center modules focus on the **Enhance Patient Engagement** priority scenario by communicating effectively with patients with the prebuilt guidance and automated systems.

The lab for this module will focus on the healthcare story of Casey Jensen.

![Timeline Description automatically generated](./IMAGES/Lab03/L3P2.png)

Casey is an avid runner but has exercise-induced asthma and requires an albuterol inhaler to help her breathe while running. Casey has realized that her current albuterol inhaler is low on medication and decides that it's a good time to get a refill.

In this lab, you'll first play the role of a Lamna Healthcare system administrator, where you'll set up the Patient Access portal and various tools in the Patient Service Center application. Next, you'll play the role of Casey, who will sign in to the portal, navigate the various options, interact with the Azure Health Bot, and escalate to a live agent in Patient Service Center to refill the medication.

## Learning objectives

In this lab, you will:

-   Configure and navigate the Patient Access Portal
-   Create and configure Agent Scripts to show in the Productivity Pane
-   Create and configure Knowledge Articles
-   Experience escalation scenario from Patient Portal through Azure Health Bot into Patient Service Center

## Exercise 1: Configure & Navigate the Patient Access Portal

In this exercise, you will learn how to do the following:

1.  Configure an external website to the Healthcare Patient Portal template
2.  Create a registration code and invite a patient to create an account for the website
3.  Log in as a patient to navigate the features of the healthcare website

The **Healthcare Patient Portal** is a template installed in your environment by the Patient Access module in Microsoft Cloud Solution Center when Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare was deployed.

A **Portal** is an external website that allows for communication between a company and its users. In this case, the Lamna Healthcare Company wants an external website for their patients to access their medical history and communicate effectively with the institution. The Healthcare Patient Portal template tailors the website’s user interface for a healthcare company focusing on secure communication, information access, and an overall improved patient experience.

Here’s what you should see after configuring and logging into the Healthcare Patient Portal:

If you’d like to learn more about portals, check out Microsoft Docs: [What is Power Apps portals?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/portals/overview)

### Task 1: Configure the Healthcare Patient Portal

Prior to deploying Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare, we created a portal in your environment using the **Customer Self-Service** template. This was a prerequisite to install the Healthcare Patient Portal as part of the Patient Access module.

Lamna Healthcare wants to associate the previously installed Customer Self-Service portal with the **Healthcare Patient Portal** template, so the correct website is displayed to the user. The following steps will guide you through how to bind your website to the proper template and restart the portal for changes to apply.

We will first open the Portal to show the Customer Self-Service template currently bound. After the configuration steps in this task, you will see the new Healthcare Patient Portal user interface.

1. [] Navigate to +++https://make.powerapps.com+++ in an In-Private or Incognito window.

1. [] Select the correct environment from the upper right **Environment** dropdown.

## Exercise 2: Configure Agent Scripts

Lamna Healthcare Company wants to ensure they have proper tools in place to provide the best service and guidance during patient interactions.

Patient Service Center has a **productivity pane** which is an auxiliary work area which contains tools that support or expedite an agent's tasks when engaging with patients. During a patient engagement, it will be embedded directly on the screen next to patient information and can be collapsed or expanded as needed.

See the following documentation to learn more about the productivity pane: [Productivity pane overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/omnichannel/administrator/productivity-pane)

**Agent Scripts** are one of the tools in the productivity pane that agents can use to help with patient care. Agent Scripts provide guidance for a specific situation and help organizations be unified, accurate, and effective while also being faster and more efficient with patients. The scripts ensure that only accurate, company-endorsed information is being shared and help reduce error and improve customer satisfaction.

In this exercise, you will create an agent script to appear in the productivity pane in Patient Service Center. The following screen shows the productivity pane on the right-hand side with the Agent Scripts tab showing. The agent script selected is Validate Patient Information and there are two steps shown. You will not see this below output until the final exercise in this lab while testing escalation, however, you will be creating the components needed to display in the productivity pane later.

![Graphical user interface, application Description automatically generated](./IMAGES/Lab03/L3P61.png)

### Task 1: Assign Productivity Tools Administrator Role

In this task, you will assign the necessary roles to your user to create and use agent scripts. Specifically, you will be adding the **Productivity tools administrator** and **Productivity tools user** roles. The Productivity tools administrator can do any action (create/read/write/append/delete) on the agent script, while the Productivity tools user only has read capabilities. Since we are creating them, we need the administrator role.

See the following documentation to learn more about these roles: [Assign roles and enable users for Omnichannel for Customer Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/omnichannel/administrator/add-users-assign-roles#understand-roles-and-their-privileges)
