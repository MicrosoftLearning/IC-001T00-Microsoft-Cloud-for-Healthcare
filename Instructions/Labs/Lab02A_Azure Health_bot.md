# Module 4 Lesson 1- Lab 2A: Azure Health Bot

## Overview

The Azure Health Bot Service is a cloud platform that empowers developers in healthcare organizations to build and deploy their compliant, AI-powered Patient insights and health bots, that help them improve processes and reduce costs. It allows you to offer your users intelligent and personalized access to health-related information and interactions through a natural conversation experience.

With the service, healthcare organizations can build a "health bot instance" and integrate it with their systems that patients, nurses, doctors, and other representatives interact with. Building an instance allows you to:

-   Improve processes
-   Improve services
-   Improve outcomes
-   Reduces cost

The Health Bot Service contains **a built-in medical database**, including **triage protocols**. You can also extend a health bot instance to include your own scenarios and integrate with other IT systems and data sources. To learn more about Azure Health Bot, see [Azure Health Bot Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/health-bot/) on Microsoft Docs.

The Azure Health Bot focuses on the Enhance patient engagement priority scenario by creating a virtual bot health option to allow for new avenues of care with embedded insights.
