# Module 4 Lesson 2 Lab 6: Virtual Visits

## Overview

Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare’s Virtual Clinic application allows clinicians to use video conferencing to provide high-quality, personalized, and affordable consultations. Using the entire meetings platform in Microsoft Teams, providers will be able to schedule, manage, and conduct virtual visits with patients. The Virtual Clinic application can then be embedded inside of Microsoft Teams to provide a practitioner with a full view of their patient’s information and history all in one unique experience.

Virtual Care focuses on the **Enhance patient engagement** priority scenario by providing a virtual health solution for scheduling and following up on virtual visits between patients, providers, and care managers.

This lab will focus on the healthcare story of Reed Flores.

![Timeline Description automatically generated](./IMAGES/Lab06/L6P2.png)

After coming home from hiking, Reed noticed he had a new rash on his right leg. He decides to schedule a virtual appointment to get a diagnosis.

In this lab, you will first play the role of a Lamna Healthcare system administrator by configuring the Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare Virtual Clinic application to be used for virtual appointments. Then, you will play the role of Reed Flores by scheduling a virtual appointment with his practitioner, Alex Johnson. Finally, you will join the virtual appointment from the view of a practitioner to observe the complete end-to-end experience.

## Learning objectives

In this lab, you will:

-   Configure the Virtual Clinic app
-   Configure Microsoft Teams for virtual visits
-   Schedule a virtual visit in the Patient Portal

## Exercise 1: Configure Virtual Clinic Application

In this exercise, you will configure the Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare Virtual Clinic application. The Virtual Clinic application allows practitioners to use video conferencing in Microsoft Teams to provide high-quality, personalized, and affordable consultations for their patients.

### Task 1: Create a new Practitioner Specialty for the Patient Portal

In this task, we are going to create a new Practitioner Specialty for the Patient Portal. Practitioner Specialties are used to define the reason why a patient is booking the virtual appointment. They are defined as Codeable Concepts records, with the type of Practitioner Specialty.

Below is an example of the appointment booking screen in the Patient Portal. As the first step in the process, the user must select a reason for their appointment.

![Graphical user interface, text, application, email Description automatically generated](./IMAGES/Lab06/L6P3.png)

For an entity that isn't shown directly in an application's sitemap, we can add a new record through Power Apps or Dynamics 365. To create a new practitioner specialty, we'll show you how to create a new Codeable Concepts record in both ways, starting with Power Apps.

1. [] Navigate to [PowerApps](https://make.powerapps.com/), +++https://make.powerapps.com/+++. Ensure the **MC4H Labs** environment is selected in the upper right. 

1. [] Expand **Dataverse** on the left sitemap and select **Tables**.

    ![Icon Description automatically generated with low confidence](./IMAGES/Lab06/L6E1T1S2.png)
    
1. [] Select the **All** tab and search for **Codeable Concept**.

    ![Icon Description automatically generated with low confidence](./IMAGES/Lab06/L6E1T1S3.png)

1. [] Select the **Codeable Concept** table and view the **Codeable Concept columns and data** tile. You'll likely see no data.

    ![Icon Description automatically generated with low confidence](./IMAGES/Lab06/L6E1T1S4.png)

1. [] Select the Show existing column dropdown, select **(Select All)** and select **Save**. Then you should see data in the system.

    ![Icon Description automatically generated with low confidence](./IMAGES/Lab06/L6E1T1S5.png)
    
1. [] At the bottom of the pane, select **Add more rows**.

1. [] On the toolbar, select **+New row** dropdown > **New row using form**.

    ![Icon Description automatically generated with low confidence](./IMAGES/Lab06/L6E1T1S6.png)

    > [!NOTE] If you receive a duplicate record error, clear the error and make a small change to the Name. Then resave.

**Congratulations!** You have created a new Practitioner Specialty that will now be available for selection as an appointment visit in the Patient Portal.

### Task 2: Configure Mapped System User on Practitioner Record

In this task, you will configure the Mapped System User field on the Practitioner record. This field should be set to the system user that maps to the contact record. In our case here, we will set it to the record associated with our logged in user. This will allow our user to act as the practitioner in the virtual visit.

There are two different places the Teams meeting may be created:

-   In the case of virtual appointments, the Teams meeting is created on the mapped user’s calendar.
-   In the case of instant virtual appointments, the Teams meeting is created on the Organizer (organizer email for virtual appointments) specified in the Admin settings.

1. [] In Power Apps, select **Apps** and then open the **Virtual Clinic** application (you may have it open in another tab already).

    ![Graphical user interface Description automatically generated](./IMAGES/Lab06/L6P8.png)

1. [] Select **People**, change the view to **Active Practitioners**, and open the **Alex Johnson** record.

    ![Graphical user interface, application Description automatically generated](./IMAGES/Lab06/L6P9.png)

1. [] Select your logged in user as the **Mapped System User**.

    ![Graphical user interface, application Description automatically generated](./IMAGES/Lab06/L6P10.png)

1. [] Select **Save & Close**. If you receive a **Duplicate records found** message, select **Ignore and Save**.

**Congratulations!** You have mapped the practitioner record to your logged in user.

### Task 3: Enable a Practitioner’s Schedule

In this task, you will configure the practitioner’s schedule to allow patients to book appointments with them using the Patient Portal. This will allow Reed to schedule an appointment with his practitioner, Alex Johnson.

1. [] In the **Virtual Clinic** app, change the sitemap area in the lower left corner from **Operations** to **Schedule Administration**.

    ![Graphical user interface, text, application Description automatically generated](./IMAGES/Lab06/L6P11.png)

1. [] On the sitemap, select **Schedules** and open the **Alex Johnson schedule** record.

    ![Table Description automatically generated](./IMAGES/Lab06/L6P12.png)

1. [] Verify the toolbar at the top shows **Deactivate** as a choice instead of **Activate**. This means the schedule is active. Select the back arrow.

    ![Graphical user interface, text, application Description automatically generated](./IMAGES/Lab06/L6P13.png)

**Congratulations!** You have verified a practitioner’s schedule is enabled to be used for booking virtual appointments.

### Task 4: Configure Slots

In this task, we will configure a new appointment slot to show practitioner’s availability. This will allow patients to select an available appointment time slot when booking with a practitioner. In this case, we will enable the practitioner, Alex Johnson, to be available today at a set time for virtual appointments.

1. [] In the **Virtual Clinic** app, select **Slots** on the Site Map and select **+ New**.

    ![Graphical user interface, table Description automatically generated](./IMAGES/Lab06/L6P14.png)

1. [] Fill in the following record details and select **Save & Close**.
