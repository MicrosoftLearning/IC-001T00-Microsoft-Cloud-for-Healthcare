# Module 4 Lesson 1- Lab 2B: Configuring Omnichannel

## Overview

Dynamics 365 Omnichannel integration allows the patient to interact with Health Bot using the Dynamics 365 chat widget to access the medical knowledge and your custom scenarios. It also allows the escalation of a bot conversation to a live agent to continue the interaction. When escalating a conversation, Dynamics passes along the conversation history and the context to the agent.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./IMAGES/Lab02/L2P60.png)

**Congratulations!** You have created the necessary queue to escalate to human agent and added the appropriate users to each messaging queue.


### Task 4: Update Live Work Stream with Context Variables and Routing Rules

Workstreams are containers to enrich, route, and assign work items. A workstream is associated with a channel, such as live chat, voice, or case. After a bot is added to a workstream, the incoming work item is first routed to the selected bot at runtime based off classification rules. For more information, see Create workstreams for unified routing on Microsoft Learn.

In this task, we will set up basic chat routing. This will allow for users to chat with a bot user in certain cases and a live human agent in other scenarios. The routing rules will allow chat to behave as follows:

-   **Route to Bot:** Initial customer conversation is through Health Bot in the default messaging queue. When the chat bot is first opened, route to Default queue which only contains the bot user (agent).
-   **Human Routing Rule**: When context variable **EscalateToAgent** is present and set to 1, we route to the queue that has only human users (agents) who can take over conversation.

1. [] Navigate to **Workstreams**.

    ![Table Description automatically generated](./IMAGES/Lab02/L2P61.png)

## Exercise 3: Extend Azure Health Bot with Custom Scenarios

**Dynamics 365 Omnichannel** integration allows the patient to interact with **Azure Health Bot** using the Dynamics 365 chat widget to access the medical knowledge and your custom scenarios. It also, allows the escalation of a bot conversation to a live agent to continue the interaction. When escalating a conversation, Dynamics passes along the conversation history and the context to the agent.

In this exercise, you will be doing the following:

-   Designing the below Health Bot Scenario called **MCH_PatientService**

    ![Diagram Description automatically generated](./IMAGES/Lab02/L2P92.png)

-   Design another Health Bot Scenario called **MCH_PatientServiceWelcome**. This scenario holds the starting statement which will allow the user to invoke the **MCH_PatientService** scenario.
-   Set the **Automatic Welcome Scenario** to be the MCH_PatientServiceWelcome custom scenario you create. This will begin the scenario when a user first interacts with the Health Bot.

### Task 1: Create MCH_PatientService Scenario
